about=This plugin is for finding shortest path between two point layers based on one line layer used as a network layer. Plugin was inspired by water utility network maintenance process where Loggers are sensors and Leaks are faults on the pipeline. Pipe network - line layer (should have attributes like a pipe diameter, pipe material, etc) Leak - point layer (should have ID, Logger ID, lat, long attributes) Logger - point layer (should have ID, lat, long attributes) For the path finding is used Dijkstra's algorithm and output is a new memory line layer with same attributes as a network layer plus full length attribute. Download test layers package here:  https://github.com/rewaza/rewaza.github.io/blob/main/shortpath/test_net.zip
